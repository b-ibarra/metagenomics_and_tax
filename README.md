# Taxonomy and Data Analysis Repository 🦠🧬📊📒

## Hi there! Welcome to this repository, currently under construction, focusing on taxonomic data analysis

### By B-Ibarra

#### About this repository
Here, you'll find code, examples, and documentation related to shotgun-derived sequencing taxonomic data analysis. While the focus is currently on shotgun data, I have plans to include some examples about 16S data soon. 

All analysis were performed using R libraries. Feel free to explore the files. If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me! 🧙🏼‍♀️🪄📈

All pipelines within this repository were developed by me during my PhD. The datasets used were obtained from my experiments, which are currently undergoing the publication process. Therefore, I am not sharing them (yet).
I adhere to ethical standards, and as such, I provide references in case they are needed. If you have any questions regarding the data sources or methodologies employed, feel free to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting!
